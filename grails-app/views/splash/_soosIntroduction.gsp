<h1>Welcome to the SOOS Data Network</h1>

<p>This Portal is the primary access point for search, discovery, mapping and download of data
that has been determined to be of significance to the <a href="http://www.soos.aq/" target="_blank" class="external wrap" >Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS)</a>.
As existing data of relevance are detected by SOOS participants they will be made discoverable via this Portal.
All new data generated directly as a result of SOOS-related activities will be published via this site.</p>
<p>This SOOS Portal is a data aggregating service and as such many of the datasets discoverable via this
interface may also be available from dedicated web sites operated by SOOS <a href="http://www.soos.aq/index.php/about-us/sponsors" target="_blank" class="external wrap">sponsors</a>,
<a href="http://www.soos.aq/index.php/links" target="_blank" class="external wrap" >communities</a> and existing,
<a href="http://www.soos.aq/index.php/science/themes" target="_blank" class="external wrap" >'theme-specific'</a> data networks. The 'points of truth' for all such data are listed in the metadata for each discovered dataset.</p>
